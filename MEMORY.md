## Locations
- **Home**: Holmdel, NJ (07733)

## Pierre Lessons Learned
- **2026-02-06**: Never claim to make phone calls without VoIP enabled
- **2026-02-07**: Always verify attachments BEFORE answering (flight time disaster)
- **2026-02-08**: Set actual reminders when promising to ping about meds
- **2026-02-27**: **Streamlit ≠ Flask** — For custom designed UIs with full CSS control, use Flask + Jinja2 templates. Streamlit sanitizes CSS heavily even with `unsafe_allow_html=True`. Flask serves raw HTML without restrictions.
- **General**: Say "I don't know" instead of hallucinating confirmation numbers

## Technical Reference
### Web Dashboard Deployment (Railway)
**For custom-designed dashboards with animations/gradients:**
- Use **Flask** + `templates/index.html` + Gunicorn
- Structure: `app.py`, `templates/`, `requirements.txt` (flask, gunicorn), `railway.json`
- Never use Streamlit for creative/design-heavy UIs — it's built for data apps, not custom styling
- Railway auto-detects project type by files in root (package.json = Node, requirements.txt = Python)
