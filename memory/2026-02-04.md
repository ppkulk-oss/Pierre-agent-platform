## Model Migration Marathon
- Spent the ENTIRE day fighting rate limits and switching models
- Started on Opus 4.5 → terrible rate limits, Prashant couldn't reach me
- Tried multiple Sonnet versions - none worked (compatibility/API tier issues)
- Finally landed on **OpenRouter** with Sonnet 4.5 - stable!
- OpenRouter provides better rate limits + multi-provider routing

**Models tested:**
- claude-opus-4-5 (rate limit hell)
- claude-sonnet-4 (not available)
- claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
- claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  
- claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
- claude-3-5-haiku-latest
- claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
- **FINAL: openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5** ✅

## Wine Hunt
- Still searching for **Thierry Allemand Cornas Reynard**
- Prashant asked me to "keep an eye out" as he went to bed
- Previous attempts blocked by bot protection on retail sites

## Technical Notes
- PDFs from Chromium keep failing to extract (all binary)
- Three PDFs received but only United flight email was readable (text in message)
- OpenRouter finally solved the rate limit nightmare
- Config patching worked once we got OpenRouter set up

2. Download My Epic App - load girls' Epic Passes
3. Create master trip reference file
4. Continue hunting for Reynard allocation
