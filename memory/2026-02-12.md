# 2026-02-12 - Beaver Creek Trip Recap

## Trip Summary (Feb 7-11, 2026)
**Family ski trip to Beaver Creek, CO - Success!**

### Key Outcomes
- **Both girls skied all 3 days** (Feb 8-10)
- **Level 5 skiers** - major achievement for Lara (12) & Riya (14)
- Riya had **Flu B** on arrival but recovered enough to ski by Day 1
- **No Beano's Cabin** - insufficient snow for snowcat (reschedule next time)

### Trip Details
- **Lodging**: Pines Lodge, Beaver Creek (Feb 7-11)
- **Ski School**: 3-day program, both girls completed
- **Weather**: Bluebird conditions (as predicted)
- **Flights**: UA2455/UA1888 (EWR→EGE) + UA1262/UA2161 (EGE→EWR)
- **Overall**: "Great trip" per Prashant

### Lessons Learned
- Kids can power through illness at altitude when motivated
- Ski school investment worth it - Level 5 opens up terrain
- Beano's requires good snow conditions for snowcat operation
- Pierre's hallucinations didn't ruin the trip (barely) 😅

### Next Time
- Book Beano's Cabin (conditions permitting)
- Consider longer trip now that girls are stronger skiers
- Splendido wine list exploration (maybe)
