## Agent Fleet Expansion
- **Allemand** spawned for wine allocation warfare (tracking Clape, Gonon, Allemand Reynard)
- **Odyssey** spawned for travel planning (Japan trip April 1-10, 2026)
- **Platform Architect** spawned to design full agent platform architecture

## Japan Trip Planning Complete
- Full 10-day itinerary created: Tokyo → Hakone → Kyoto → Osaka
- Restaurant guide with dietary accommodations (Riya veg, Lara picky, Tejal no-beef)
- Logistics guide (transport, passes, tickets)
- Packing checklist with prep timeline
- Files stored in memory/odyssey-*.md

## Platform Architecture Decisions
- **Stack:** ChromaDB (vectors), Redis (messaging), Docker Compose deployment
- **Integration:** Obsidian vault for knowledge base, bidirectional sync
- **MCP:** Calendar, finance, email external connections planned
- **Hosting dilemma:** Railway hobby plan too limited for full stack
- **Solution:** Hybrid - Railway for orchestration + Supabase for data ($5-25/mo)

## Key Conversations
- Prashant wants to "boast to any asshole nerd" - ambitious multi-agent system desired
- Weekend MVP vs 4-month full build discussed
- Decided on iterative approach: start simple, expand

## UI Improvements
- Prashant hates Telegram text walls for complex data
- Odyssey building Streamlit dashboard for Japan trip
- Plan to use Plotly for maps, interactive filters for restaurants
- Local-first approach: `streamlit run scripts/japan-dashboard.py`

## Files Created Today
- memory/wine-warfare.md (Allemand's wine tracking system)
- memory/odyssey-japan-itinerary.md
- memory/odyssey-restaurants.md
- memory/odyssey-logistics.md
- memory/odyssey-packing.md
- memory/odyssey-contingency.md
- memory/odyssey-japan-index.md
- memory/odyssey-travel-system.md
- (In progress) scripts/japan-dashboard.py

## Architecture Reviews Completed
- **Architecture Summarizer** created shareable summary at memory/architecture-shareable-summary.md
- **DevOps Architect** created critical review at memory/architecture-review-devops.md
- Key critique: Redis Pub/Sub has fire-and-forget issues, Railway+Supabase split is overkill
- Alternative suggested: Single VPS ($5-10/mo) with SQLite, monolith-first approach
- Email draft created at memory/email-architecture-review-draft.txt for colleague feedback

## Decisions Pending
- Awaiting colleague feedback on architecture
- Streamlit dashboard still in progress (write truncation issues)
- Decision needed: Full distributed system vs simple monolith

## Next Steps
1. Review Streamlit dashboard when Odyssey completes
2. Get colleague feedback on architecture
3. Decide on Phase 1 MVP scope (monolith vs distributed)
4. Set up Discord server for agent channels (postponed)
5. Consider spawning Finance agent next
