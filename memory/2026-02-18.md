## Pierre Gonon Hunt Update
- Created standalone script: `/data/workspace/scripts/gonon-hunt.mjs`
- Uses Tavily search directly (no Brave API needed)
- Script works perfectly, logs to `/data/workspace/logs/gonon-hunt.log`
- **Cron job setup failed** - need workaround

## Latest Findings:
- **2022 vintage** available at Kermit Lynch (in stock)
- **2007 vintage** at Rare Wine Co. - $295 (limit 1)
- **2022 at in vino & spirits** - out of stock
- No local NJ shops near 07733 yet

## Workaround Plan:
- Manual script runs when requested
- Or set up host system cron if access available
- Script is production-ready, just needs trigger mechanism

## Files Created:
- `/data/workspace/scripts/gonon-hunt.mjs` (3,240 bytes)
- `/data/workspace/logs/gonon-hunt.log` (ongoing)
- `/data/workspace/memory/gonon-seen.md` (deduplication tracking)
