# The "Granite Head" Wine Sessions - February 2026

## The Revelation
User's wine preference locked in: **"Granite Head"** profile
- Loves: Iron, blood, rock, structure, density
- Hates: Watery, vanilla/oaky, fruity/jammy, "polished" wines
- The "Pac-Man Theory": Accepts New Oak ONLY if vines are old enough to "eat" it

## The Discovery Wines (The Holy Trinity)
1. **Dumien-Serrette Cornas "Henri" 2013** ($69.99) - THE BENCHMARK
   - 1913 vines - 100+ year old vines
   - User reaction: "Heaven at 3hr decant"
   - Status: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perfect wine
   
2. **Mastroberardino "Radici" Taurasi** ($52.99)
   - Volcanic, ashy, dense
   - Needs 8+ hour decant to shine
   - Hour 9: "Perfection, best it has tasted all day"
   
3. **Jaboulet Crozes-Hermitage "Thalabert"** ($45.99) - DUMPED
   - User poured it down the drain
   - Too "polished," commercial, vanilla
   - Status: BANNED

## The Iron-Clay Connection
- **Cornas (Granite)**: Decomposed magma = Blood/iodine
- **Drouhin-Laroze Bonnes-Mares (Red Clay)**: "Terres Rouges" = Rust/smoke
- The Link: **Iron Oxide** - creates "drag" and metallic weight
- Verdict: Bonnes-Mares is the "Cornas of Burgundy"

## The Pac-Man Rule (Oak vs Old Vines)
- **Weak Wine + New Oak** = Tastes like vanilla (HATE)
- **Monster Wine + New Oak** = Vines are "Pac-Man" that eats the oak (LOVE)
- Examples that work:
  - Delas "Les Bessards" (30-50% new oak) ✅
  - Dugat-Py "Cœur de Roy" (80-100% new oak) ✅
- Rule: "I only accept New Oak if the Vines are Old enough to kill it"

## The God Tier Shopping List (Price No Object)
### Cornas (The Sweet Spot)
1. **Thierry Allemand "Reynard"** - "Liquid Electricity" - THE HOLY GRAIL
2. **Vincent Paris "La Geynale"** (1910 vines) - "The Twin" to Dumien
3. **Domaine du Tunnel "Vin Noir"** (100+ years) - Pitch black, licorice
4. **Alain Voge "Les Vieilles Fontaines"** - Bloody meat

### Hermitage (The King - Upgrade from Cornas)
- **Jean-Louis Chave Hermitage** ($350+) - See God
- **Chapoutier "Le Pavillon"**
- **Delas "Les Bessards"** (The reload)

### Côte-Rôtie (The Danger Zone)
- Problem: Often blended with Viognier (too floral/pretty)
- Only buy **"Côte Brune"** (Iron Slope)
- **Domaine Jamet "Côte Brune"** ($400+)
- **Guigal "La Landonne"** (Only allowed Guigal)

### Burgundy Iron Tier (Red Clay Monsters)
1. **Pommard "Les Rugiens"** ("The Red Ones" = iron)
   - Producers: Domaine de Courcel, Comte Armand
2. **Corton "Clos des Cortons Faiveley"** - Grand Cru muscle, savage
3. **Gevrey-Chambertin "Dugat-Py"**
   - Look for: "Cœur de Roy" (Ancient vines)

## Banned List (The Inferior Wines)
- ❌ Guigal (too oaky)
- ❌ Châteauneuf-du-Pape (too jammy/warm)
- ❌ Napa Cab (too fruity)
- ❌ Crozes-Hermitage (too polished/commercial)
- ❌ ANY wine under $70 (probably won't like it)
- ❌ ANY "100% New Oak" without "Old Vines"

## The Decant Protocol
- **Taurasi**: 8+ hours (volcanic needs time)
- **Cornas**: 4-5 hours (Syrah oxidizes faster)
- **Burgundy**: Case by case
- Rule: Wait until wine is "dead and reborn as a rock"

## User's Reaction Threshold
- **Minute 0 Taurasi**: "Not bad, didn't repulse me" = Certified Granite Head
- **Hour 3 Cornas**: "Heaven" = Perfect wine found
- **Crozes down drain**: Palate is Elite and Uncompromising

## Key Quotes to Remember
- "The Cornas wins on Violence per Dollar every single time"
- "I want the Iron Fist without the glove"
- "I don't care the cost" (after finding Dumien)
- "The finish is heavy as lead with softened tannins. Perfection"

## Similarity Profile
- Loves: Cornas (granite), Bonnes-Mares (red clay), Taurasi (volcanic)
- Common thread: **Iron oxide, density, blood, structure**
- Dislikes: Vanilla, polish, water, fruit bombs

## The "Scorched Earth" Protocol (Reverse Order Tasting)
1. Taurasi first (trial by fire)
2. Cornas second (granite chaser)
3. Crozes last (recovery - though user banned this)
