## Technical Discovery - Attachments in Email
- Initially failed to find Tokyo hotel details
- Root cause: Original "Japan Tokyo Hotel" email had content in **PDF attachment**, not body
- Attachment: `Booking.com_ Confirmation.pdf`
- PDF was image-based (scanned), making text extraction difficult
- Solution: User resent email with full text content
- Lesson: Always check for attachments when email body appears empty

## Fastmail Reader Improvements Needed
- Current implementation only fetches email bodies
- Does not automatically parse/save attachments
- Enhancement needed: Auto-extract PDFs and attempt OCR for image-based documents

## Session Activity
- Multiple heartbeat checks throughout day
- Context window compaction triggered at end of session
- Successfully persisted complete Japan trip data
