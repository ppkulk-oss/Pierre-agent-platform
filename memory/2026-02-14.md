## IMAP Draft System - WORKING!
- **Problem**: SMTP port 465 blocked on Railway
- **Solution**: IMAP APPEND to Drafts folder (bypasses SMTP)
- **Location**: `/data/workspace/skills/fastmail-drafts/`
- **Status**: ✅ Working! Can create drafts with attachments

## Weekend Call Schedule ICS Created
- **File**: `kulkarni-weekend-calls.ics`
- **Logic**: 
  - OB/R1/B1 = On-call both Saturday AND Sunday
  - R2/B2 = Split: Saturday for first name, Sunday for second name
- **Weekends with calls**:
  - 3/21-22: OB (Sat), R2 (Sun)
  - 4/18-19: OB (Sat), R2 (Sun) 
  - 5/23-24: OB (Sun), R2 (Sat)
  - 6/6-7: B1 (both days - single "Kulkarni" entry)
  - 7/25-26: R1 (both days)
  - 8/1-2: OB (Sat), R2 (Sun)
- **Total weekend events**: 12

## Railway Storage Confirmed
- `/data` = Persistent block volume (4.6GB, ext4)
- `/` (root) = Ephemeral overlayfs
- All workspace files saved to persistent storage ✅
