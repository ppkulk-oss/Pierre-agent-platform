## Budget Tracking Decision
- Decided to stick with **Origin** ($99/year) instead of switching to Tiller ($79/year)
- Reason: Avoid migration hassle, Origin's AI is worth the extra $20
- Has `pierredugatpy@gmail.com` account ready if he ever wants to switch to Tiller later
- Pierre can set up budget monitoring via Google Sheets API if/when he switches

- Has schedule PDF: `RMC - BMC 09_2025 to 03_2026.pdf` in downloads
