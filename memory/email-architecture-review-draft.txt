Subject: Architecture Review Request - Multi-Agent Platform

Hi [Colleague Name],

I'm working on a personal project - a multi-agent AI platform to help manage various aspects of my life (travel planning, wine allocations, calendar, finance, etc.). Think of it as specialized AI agents that collaborate on tasks.

I've put together an architecture proposal and would love your professional opinion before I start building. I've attached two documents:

**1. architecture-shareable-summary.md** - The high-level proposal
   - 4-layer architecture (Client → Orchestration → Services → Knowledge)
   - Stack: ChromaDB, Redis, Supabase, Railway
   - Estimated cost: $15-85/month
   - 16-week build timeline

**2. architecture-review-devops.md** - A critical review (by a DevOps consultant)
   - Calls out Redis Pub/Sub as problematic (fire-and-forget semantics)
   - Questions the ChromaDB + Obsidian dual storage approach
   - Suggests a single $5 VPS with SQLite instead of Railway + Supabase split
   - Worries about premature optimization

**Specific questions I'd love your take on:**
- Is the Railway + Supabase split worth the complexity, or is a single VPS the smarter play?
- The Redis Pub/Sub concern seems valid - should I just use direct function calls between agents?
- Am I over-engineering this for a personal system?

**Context:** This is a hobby project running on a Railway hobby plan. I want something impressive enough to "boast to any asshole nerd" (my words) but I also don't want to spend weekends debugging distributed systems.

Any feedback appreciated - no need for a novel, just gut reactions and red flags.

Thanks!
Prashant

P.S. - Current agents in the fleet:
- Allemand (wine allocation hunter)
- Odyssey (travel planning - just built a Japan trip dashboard)
- Future: Finance agent, Calendar agent
