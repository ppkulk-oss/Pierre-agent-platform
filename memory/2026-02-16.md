## Balthazar & Gilles Purchased
- 2019 Franck Balthazar Cornas "Chaillot" ($150) - bought

## Tracker Files Created/Updated
- book-tracker.md: Recursion, Silent Patient, pairings
- movie-tracker.md: 13 films at 10/10 now (added Incendies, Arrival, John Wick 1-4, The Call)
- wine-tracker.md: Unchanged

## Cron Job Issue
- "Daily Pierre Gonon Wine Hunt" running daily at 5am UTC
- Failing because still trying to use Brave Search API
- Need to fix to use Tavily skill instead
- User asked for fix options

## Key Learnings
- User is "Texture Hunter" (Top 1%) - Liquid Geology seeker
- 2012 Las Cases bought (instead of 2003) - serve COLD (60°F)
- User impulse buys when excited (2012 Las Cases despite warning)
- Priorat 2019 = God Bottle (2020 was rainy)
