*The absolute pinnacle of "Structure, Iron, and Granite" winemaking*
*Profile: Anti-Watery, Anti-Makeup. Structure, Iron, and Granite.*

| # | Producer | Wine | Vintages | Target Price | Nickname | Why |
|---|----------|------|----------|--------------|----------|-----|
| 1 | **Domaine Auguste Clape** | Cornas | 2019, 2015 | $225-275 | "Desert Island" | 100% whole cluster, zero new oak. The definition of "Liquid Rock." 2019 is a masterpiece of density. |
| 2 | **Domaine Jamet** | Côte-Rôtie | 2019, 2022 | $250-325 | "Feral King" | Smells like blood, iron, and olives. 100% whole cluster fruit creates a "wild" wine. |
| 3 | **Château Montrose** | Saint-Estèphe | 2016, 2010 | $220-280 | "Latour of Saint-Estèphe" | Most tannic, masculine, brooding Left Bank wine. The 2016 is a 100-point legend of pure graphite. |
| 4 | **Domaine Tempier** | Bandol "Cabassaou" | 2019, 2020 | $140-180 | "Meat Monster" | 95% Mourvèdre from ancient vines. Tastes like leather, game, and black rock. Can wrestle a Cornas to a draw. |
| 5 | **Clos Mogador** | Priorat | 2019 | $110-130 | "Slate Monster" | Made from Llicorella (black slate). Mimics the "Lead Pencil" finish of Las Cases with more alcohol and weight. |
| 6 | **Paolo Bea** | Sagrantino di Montefalco "Pagliaro" | 2015, 2017 | $130-160 | "Friction King" | Highest tannin count of any grape. Natural winemaking (no sulfur/additives). Dry, earthy, coats mouth in dust. |
| 7 | **Marc Sorrel** | Hermitage "Le Gréal" | 2019 | $180-240 | "Blood of Hermitage" | Arch-traditionalist. Top cuvée from Méal and Greffieux plots. Thick, bloody, unpolished. |
| 8 | **Domaine Dugat-Py** | Gevrey-Chambertin "Cœur de Roy" TVV | 2019, 2020 | $175-220 | "Iron Pinot" | 50-100 year old vines. So concentrated it tastes black. Solves "Pinot is too light" problem. |
| 9 | **Cappellano** | Barolo "Pie Rupestris" | 2016, 2019 | $250-350 | "Anti-Modernist" | Teobaldo Cappellano banned critics from reviewing his wines. Savory, herbal, uncompromisingly tannic. |
| 10 | **Thierry Allemand** | Cornas "Chaillot" | 2018, 2019 | $350-400 | "Cult Reference" | From hot years = accessible sooner. The granite benchmark. Need at least one to measure others against. |
| BONUS | **Alain Voge** | Cornas "Les Vieilles Vignes" | 2019, 2020 | $200-250 | - | Previously requested hunt target. |
